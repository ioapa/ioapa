### Aloha 👋😃
- 🤯 I recently transitioned from WebGL to WebGPU and am now experimenting with this new API. I'm focusing on learning about design choices and patterns to enhance my code. While JavaScript is my forte, I've also curated other interesting projects in my portfolio! 🔭
- 😍 I am really proud to say that I managed to program a running chess application in under 10 weeks using Csharp, which is a new language for me!
- 🙈 I would really like to look in to TypeScript... maybe next project?
- 🎓 I am currently studying *Web Development* full-time.
