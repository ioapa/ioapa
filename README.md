🤠 Recently transitioned to WebGPU and am now exploring this new API. 🔭 My focus lies in understanding design choices and patterns to enhance my code. 📦 Currently, I emphasize creating testable, modular, and maintainable code. 📸 I put weight into developing tests that tell a story, enabling me to replicate unwritten code. 👽 While JavaScript is my forte, my portfolio includes other intriguing projects! 🙈 Check out my [Invaders](https://github.com/samme90s/invaders) project in TypeScript, open for contributions. 🎓 I'm currently a full-time Web Development student and a part-time TA (teaching assistant), helping fellow students.
