### Aloha 👋😃
🤯 I recently transitioned from *WebGL* to *WebGPU* and am now experimenting with this new API, focusing on learning about design choices and patterns to enhance my code. 🔭 JavaScript is my forte, but I've also curated other interesting projects in my portfolio! 😍 I'm really proud to say that I managed to program a running chess application in under 10 weeks using Csharp, which is a new language for me! 🙈 I would really like to look in to TypeScript... maybe next project? 🎓 I am currently studying Web Development full-time.
