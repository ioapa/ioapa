### Aloha 👋😃
🥰 Recently, I switched from *WebGL* to *WebGPU* and am now delving into this new API. 🔭 My focus lies in understanding design choices and patterns to enhance my code. 📦Currently, I'm emphasizing the creation of testable, modular, and maintainable code. 📸 I enjoy crafting tests that tell a story, enabling me to replicate code that hasn't been written yet. 👽 While JavaScript is my forte, my portfolio includes other intriguing projects! 🙈 Check out my [Invaders](https://github.com/samme90s/invaders) project written in TypeScript, open for contributions. 🎓 I am currently studying Web Development full-time and helping other students as a teaching assistant. 🤠 Ciao!
